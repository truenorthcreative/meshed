# Meshed - GitHub Traffic App

There are a couple of default build commands you can run.

Run an `npm install` to install all dependencies.  


## DEV SERVER
`npm run dev` will run webpack-dev-server and expose it to `localhost:8080`



## Production
`npm run build` -- will build in production

Note: `NODE_ENV=production` must be set for production build and exclusions. It is already set in `npm run build` script
